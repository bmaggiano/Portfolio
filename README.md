# Brandon Maggiano: Portfolio

## Description

This portfolio will serve to be my resume for potential employers. The purpose of this project is to display my front end HTML, CSS and advanced CSS skills as well as act as a placeholder to link all my current, past, and future projects. My portfolio is not only something that will allow me to see my progress throughout the learning process, but something that will need to be updated constantly as my skills grow and develop. 

A couple of key concepts that really stuck with me throughout this process are flexbox, creating responsiveness using transitions with CSS, and creating "cards" that will respond to any size of screen. Media queries were another big part of this and I really had to take into consideration what my users will be viewing this with.

For emojis, I'm using font awesome ("https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css") and linking that in the index.html file.

For background images, I'm mostly using Unsplash for free high-res photos ("https://unsplash.com/")

## Your Task

Welcome to this week's Challenge! This is an even-numbered week, so you won't be given any starter code. Instead, you'll create a web application from scratch! This week, you'll build a portfolio page, which you can add to as the course progresses. 

A portfolio of work can showcase your skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights your strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. Students who have portfolios with deployed web applications (meaning they are live on the web) are typically very successful in their career search after the boot camp. This last point can’t be stressed enough: having several deployed projects is a minimum requirement to receive an initial interview at many companies. 

With these points in mind, in this Challenge you’ll set yourself up for future success by applying the core skills you've recently learned: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. You'll get to practice your new skills while creating something that you will use during your job search. It’s a win-win that you'll likely be grateful for in the future!

**Note:** If you don't have enough web applications to showcase at this point, use placeholder images and names. You can change them to real applications as you create them later in the course.

Let’s take a look at what a user story written from the perspective of a hiring manager might look like. As you might remember from your first Challenge, we follow the AS AN / I WANT / SO THAT format.
